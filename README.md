## Finding the current inside a material

 
- Given the voltage Vr, Current Ir, dimensions of the material l x w x h and n = $free charge/per unit volume$.
- To find the current Ir = $Change in charge(dQ) / Change in time (dt)$
- Let us take a thin sheet and find the sheet charge (Qs) and Q be the total charge of the material.

 - The current can be written as the total charge in the incremental volume in time &#9651;t:                                                                
   - $I_R$ = $&#9651;q \over &#9651;t$ = $Q_s&#9651;x \over &#9651;t$ = $Q_sV_d$ ,  [ $Q_s$ = nwh is the sheet charge or the charge per unit length,  $V_d$ is the average velocity of the electrons]
   - $V_d$ = $&#9651;x \over &#9651;t$ = &#956;E , [ E = $&#9651;v \over &#9651;x$ , and &#956; is the mobility of the material.]
   - $I_R$ = &#956; $Q_s$ $&#9651;v \over &#9651;x$
  - The incremental resistance can be expressed as:
    - &#9651;R = $&#9651;v \over I_R$ = $\rho$ $&#9651;x \over Wh$
## Finding the capacitance between two parallel plate

- consider two parallel metal plates of area 'A' separated by distance 'd' as shown in fig.
